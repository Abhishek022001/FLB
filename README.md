# FLB - Project on the Integration of Federated Learning and Blockchain 

## Overview

This project aims to integrate Federated Learning (FL) with blockchain technology, enhancing data privacy and security in machine learning applications. Federated Learning enables training a global model across decentralized devices holding local data samples without exchanging them. By incorporating blockchain, we can ensure a tamper-proof, transparent, and secure environment for federated learning processes.


## Setup
Clone the repo, prepare local environmentï¼š
```
conda create -n flb python=3.11
conda activate flb
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Modify config file
In our initial **config.yaml** file, you need to set your local model path and dataset_name. <br>
> Right now we only support CUDA to do training, if you want to use cpu, please delete **quantization** in config.yaml and set **device_map** to cpu.


## Federate learning finetune

To start the federated learning fine-tuning process, run the following command:

```
python main_simple_fl.py
```

## Support Blockchain

We dsign a basic blockchain protocol (`utils/blockchain.py`) to measure and reward clients in our federated learning setup. We'll use the number of parameters as the main factor for rewards.
